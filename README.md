# Simple Mail Merge

> Webstack - Portfolio Project - Pitch

**Mail merging** is a process used to create personalized emails, by merging a template containing a set of placeholders with a list of data. Placeholders often referred to as "fields," represents where the personalized information will go. The data source, provides the individual details that replace these placeholders. This allows users to efficiently produce a large number of personalized documents without having to manually input each piece of information.

This project is aimed towards creating a Simple Mail Merging application, where users can implement part of this solution into their existing products, use the API provided by this solution as a standalone service or use the entire application to manage the entire mail merging process.
